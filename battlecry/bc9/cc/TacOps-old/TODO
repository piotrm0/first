CRITICAL:

- (??) GUI: match nav/list, finals rankings/alliances/nav


REQUIRED:

- (??) "ping" cmd: determine
- add display commands? (show: match, results, rankings, pairings, ladder,
	empty, logo-game, technical, version, ...)
- add arena commands? (init, play, r/w, version, probe, ident, status,
	ondeck, clock, start, stop, enable/disable)

KNOWN BUGS:

- "who" list != "ls" list
- multi-query sql on same line != different lines (begin...)
- dB locked on Recv.
- why DB locked/in-use if conn. dropped

DESIRED:

- (high) kill/release db connection forcibly
- (low) remove static tables in db (populate)
- (med) fix history show to merge control chars
- (high) add tracing: (id | "off") arena, display, sql, cmds, responses;
  add to connection_t: bool has_tracers; trace[]: fd who, str fmt, int flags
- (med) add "su" as (add "effective_id" fd to connection_t)
- (med) for watch/notify: check for changes to rsets & only send if changed
- add semicolon processing of commands; ensure the c->db isn't released
  between successive sql commands ?
- (low) add CREATE/DROP as admin
- (low) add commandline processing
- (low) add MORE (automatic) wrapper
- add arena handler
- (low) add password protection?
- (low) add "unnotify all" command that relistens to everything
- (low) add buffer_recycle & cmd to trigger
- (low) switch from select to poll
- (low) split server.c
- (???) check multiple rules on table/view: do they override notify's?
- (med) add copyin/replace (store?) into command

COSMETIC
- (med) fix wrap: if line < maxWidth, doesn't handle newlines, etc.
- (med) fix wrap: lmargin broken
- (low) fix handling of multiple spaces which end a line (with wrap)

NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN
- remove casting for command_sjoin()
- implement sorting in "who" command
- receive terminal type subnegotiation
- handle telnet ctrl characters:
  ^Z (susp)	IAC SUSP IAC DO TELOPT_TM
  ^E (status)	IAC AYT
  ^U (kill)	IAC AYT
  ^C (intr)	IAC IP IAC DOTELOPT_TM
  ^D (eof)	^D
  ^\ (quit)	IAC BREAK IAC DO TELOPT_TM
- add event preference get/set commands
- add localization
- add recv command
- automate notify rule adding?
