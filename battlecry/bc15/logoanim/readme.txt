Process of adjusting the animation:

1. Edit num.psd to whatever year text you want in Photoshop, use the
   same style with the glow and satin effects for whatever color you
   want.

2. Export num.psd to num_noglow.png without the glow effect enabled.

3. Export num.psd to num_glow.png with the glow effect enabled.

4. In flash, view the library, and select bitmap properties of
   num_noglow.png and num_glow.png, select "import..." to select the
   new updated versions created in steps 2 and 3.

5. Edit the symbol "enter_num" under "logo" under "plates" in the
   library:

  5.a. Edit Guide: 7_p and make the line follow whatever path you want
       the laser effect to take. There is an issue in flash that
       guides cannot intersect, so try not to make the guide intersect
       itself.

  5.b. Edit the keyframes for 7_point, placing them on various
       endpoints of the path along the animation.

  5.c. Preview movie and makes sure it looks good and publish, can
       export to Quicktime or whatever is available as expert target.
